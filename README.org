* Intro
This project is a work in progress, but the goal is to make a hanging vplotter robot that is completely self contained and is controlled by the esp32.


Currently, I am working on the web interface while I wait for parts to arrive.


* Notes
  Make sure espfs is on v0.9.0. The most recent versions change how the 'espFsOpen' function is called.
