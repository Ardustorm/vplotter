* Intro
This project is a work in progress, but the goal is to make a hanging vplotter robot that is completely self contained and is controlled by the esp32.

Currently, there is support for controlling a DC motor and reading a quadrature encoder. In addition I have developed a websockets based debug interface that displays variables and allows the user to adjust them from the browser in real time.



* TODO:
- Finish supporting 2 motors/encoders
- Design and build physical frame/wheels of the robot.
- integrate esp portion and webInterface portion

* Notes
  Make sure espfs is on v0.9.0. The most recent versions change how the 'espFsOpen' function is called.
